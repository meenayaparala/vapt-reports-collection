# Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) Lab Series

This folder contains a structured series of Markdown files exploring **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)** vulnerabilities. Each file is focused on a different aspect of SSTI, ranging from basic injection to advanced exploitation techniques in sandboxed environments.

## üìÑ Contents

1. **[Basic Server-Side Template Injection](01-basic-server-side-template-injection.md)**  
   Introduction to SSTI and how to identify basic template injection points.

2. **[SSTI in Code Context](02-basic-server-side-template-injection-code-context.md)**  
   Analyzing how SSTI behaves when the input is placed inside different code contexts.

3. **[SSTI Using Documentation](03-server-side-template-injection-using-documentation.md)**  
   Leveraging available documentation and error messages to identify and exploit SSTI.

4. **[SSTI in an Unknown Language with a Documented Exploit](04-server-side-template-injection-in-an-unknown-language-with-a-documented-exploit.md)**  
   Handling SSTI in unfamiliar template engines using known public exploits.

5. **[Information Disclosure via User-Supplied Objects](05-server-side-template-injection-with-information-disclosure-via-user-supplied-objects.md)**  
   Exploiting SSTI to reveal sensitive information through object injection.

6. **[SSTI in a Sandboxed Environment](06-server-side-template-injection-in-a-sandboxed-environment.md)**  
   Bypassing template engine sandbox restrictions and escaping to execute arbitrary code.

7. **[SSTI with a Custom Exploit](07-server-side-template-injection-with-a-custom-exploit.md)**  
   Crafting custom payloads for specific SSTI scenarios and applications.

## üß† Goal

By the end of this series, you will have hands-on understanding of:

- Detecting SSTI in various contexts
- Exploiting different template engines
- Identifying ways to bypass sandbox restrictions
- Writing custom payloads and scripts

---

## üí° Recommended Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of web application structure and templating engines (Jinja2, Twig, etc.)
- Familiarity with Python or another scripting language
- An understanding of web vulnerability principles like XSS and command injection

---

## üõ† Tools You Might Use

- Burp Suite
- Postman or cURL
- Template engine documentation (e.g., Jinja2, Freemarker)
- Custom exploit scripts
